## The SEO & User Engagement Benefits

**Boost Your SEO & User Engagement:**
Adding a well-structured table of contents is one of the most effective ways to improve both your website's user experience and its visibility in search engine rankings. The Jump Links Block is more than just a navigation tool; it's a powerful feature for enhancing your SEO.

**Stand Out in Search Results:**
Google and other search engines can detect the anchor links created by this block and may feature them directly in the search results. This adds valuable "Jump to" links below your page description (also known as fragment links or in-page links), allowing users to go directly to the section that answers their question.

**Improve Click-Through Rate (CTR):**
By occupying more space in the search results and presenting a clear outline of your content, you make your listing more appealing and informative. This encourages more users to click on your link over your competitors, directly boosting your CTR—a key metric that can lead to better search engine rankings.

**Enhance User Experience:**
For long articles, a table of contents is essential. It allows readers to easily navigate to the sections they care about most, which reduces bounce rates and increases the time they spend on your page. Search engines place value on these positive user engagement signals.

**Provide Clear Context for Search Engines:**
A list of jump links acts as a clear, semantic outline of your page's structure. This helps search engines better understand the topics and sub-topics you cover, which can improve your chances of ranking for a broader range of related search queries.

## Key Features

### Automatic & Intelligent

* **Auto-Generates Links:** Scans your document in real-time and creates a list of links from your H2, H3, and H4 heading blocks. 

* **Smart Anchor ID Handling:** Automatically adds unique, semantic ID attributes to heading blocks that don't have one.

* **Respects Your Content:** Never overwrites a custom ID you've already added to a heading, giving you complete control.

* **Live Syncing:** The list automatically updates in real-time as you add, remove, or edit headings in the editor.

### Full Customization

* **Viewing & Editing Modes:** Switch between a clean preview (Viewing Mode) and a detailed interface (Editing Mode) directly in the sidebar's "Presentation" panel.

* **Custom Link Text:** Change the text of any link. For example, turn a long heading like "Frequently Asked Questions about Our Product" into a short and simple "FAQ." 

* **Custom Ordering:** Easily reorder links with simple up and down arrow buttons to create the perfect flow for your readers.

* **Toggle Visibility:** You can exclude any heading from the list with a simple "Include/Exclude" toggle.  This allows you to leave a section out of your Jump Links List, if desired.

* **Conditional Horizontal Link Styles:** When in the horizontal layout, you can fine-tune the design with controls for  **Link Background Color**, **Link Background Color on hover**, **Link Border Color**, and **border radius**.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How is the standalone "SEO 44 Jump Links Block" plugin different from the "SEO 44" plugin?
The main **[Search Appearance Toolkit (SEO 44)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search-appearance-toolkit-seo-44/)** plugin is a complete suite of tools that includes meta tag optimization, schema generation, XML sitemaps, and the Jump Links Block. This standalone **[Jump Links Block (SEO 44)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jump-links-block-seo-44)** plugin offers *only* the Jump Links Block functionality for users who don't need a full SEO suite. If you are using the Search Appearance Toolkit (SEO 44) plugin, you *already* have access to the Jump Links Block and do not need to install this standalone block plugin.

### Are Jump To Links the same as Site Links?
While they look similar, **sitelinks** and **jump to links** are two distinct features in Google's search results. The main difference is where the links take the user. 

* **Sitelinks:** Links to **separate pages** on the same website (site-level navigation). They most often appear for branded searches when Google is confident the user wants to navigate the main sections of a specific site. Their purpose is to navigate a website's main sections and help users get to the most popular or important pages on a website more quickly.

* **"Jump to" links:** Links to **different sections within the same page** (page-level navigation).  Jump To Links are also called "fragment links" or "in-page links."  They typically appear for long articles, tutorials, or FAQs where a table of contents with anchor links is used.  Their purpose is to navigate a long piece of content and take search users directly to the specific part of the page that answers their question.

**Jump To Links** are the search result feature that the Jump Links Block is designed to create. 

### Which heading levels will appear in the list? 
That's your choice. By default, the block will create a list of the H2 headings, but you can add H3 and H4 headings (or remove H2 headings) by simply checking a box (H1 and H5 headings are not included as they are less commonly used for in-page content structure). Control which levels are included in the **Heading Settings** panel in the sidebar by checking or unchecking the boxes. You can also use the **Editing Mode** screen to exclude individual headings from your list.

### How do I edit the text, reorder, or hide a specific link?
In the block's sidebar, go to the **Presentation** panel and click the **Editing Mode** button. This will reveal all the controls inside the block editor for customizing each link. When you're done, you can switch back to **Viewing Mode** to see a clean preview.

### Will this block overwrite custom anchor IDs I've already added to my headings?
No. The block is designed to be smart about this. If a heading block already has a custom anchor ID, the Jump Links Block will use that existing ID and will not overwrite it. It only adds an ID if one is missing.  The anchor ID is required to create semantic jump links.

**Note:** If one of the headings on your page is “Office Directions,” the ID created will be “office-directions.” This could create a potential conflict if you have another ID on your webpage named “office-directions.” In this case, assign a different ID to the block heading to resolve the conflict.

### Why does the "Show More" button not work in the editor?
The collapsible functionality and the **Show More** button, which features a down arrow icon, are front-end features that function using a JavaScript file. They are designed to work only on the live, published page. To give you an accurate preview, the editor displays a non-functional replica of the "Show More" button when the feature is enabled. You can hover over it to see a helpful tooltip, and clicking it will show an informational notice confirming that it's interactive on the front end.

### How do I style the links in the horizontal layout?
The special styling options for the horizontal layout (like link background and border color) will automatically appear in the **Appearance** panel in the sidebar *after* you select the "Horizontal" layout option.

### How can I save and reuse my custom styles for the Jump Links Block?
You can save a fully customized Jump Links block as a **Block Pattern** to easily reuse it across your site. This is a handy WordPress feature.  With Block Patterns, you don't have to repeat the process of manually setting the same style settings for Jump Links blocks on multiple pages.  That work is done for you.

Here’s how:

1.  **Style Your Block:** Add the SEO 44 Jump Links block to a page and style it exactly how you want using the settings in the sidebar (colors, layout, border radius, etc.).

2.  **Open the Options Menu:** With the block selected, click the three-dot (⋮) options menu on the block's toolbar.

3.  **Create the Pattern:** From the dropdown menu, select **Create pattern**. A pop-up window will appear.
    
4.  **Name and Configure:**
    * Give your pattern a name (e.g., "Super Stylish Jump Links").
    * You will see a toggle for **Synced**. This is an important choice:
        * **Avoid Synced (ON):** Don't use this setting, which will prevent you from accessing the Jump Link Block's customization features, like being able to re-order or rename the jump links.
        * **Use Synced (OFF):** Turn synced off before saving your custom pattern. This will create a regular pattern that, when added to other posts, renders a Jump Links Block with all your favorite styles preloaded. This independent copy of your original styled block, created through your new pattern, has full customization controls. **Synced Off is the way to go!**

5.  **Click Create:** Your custom pattern is now saved!

6.  **Reuse Your Pattern:** To use it on another page, click the main block inserter (+), go to the **Patterns** tab, and select the "My patterns" category. You will see your saved design, ready to be inserted with one click.
